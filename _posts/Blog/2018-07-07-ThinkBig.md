I recently worked on scoping a video template project, my manager gave me some very good feedback on a framework to doing project proposal.

When you are working on a BIG proposal
* new technical project idea
* product proposal
* road map funding

A good way to start structuring your thoughts might follow
* Why: the benefits of doing this: what painpoints/problems it's solving, what's not ideal in current state.
* What: what the ideal state should be.
* How: what's the road map to get there -- this usually comes with
  * multi-phase steps, from MVP/V0 to a more extended features/platformrize
  * start with a couple of prototype ideas with small investment
  * validate your assumptions and fail fast along the way
  * eventually what's most important is probably the first milestone (MVP): given current resource, timeline, what is the minimum of efforts that has the most opportunity

This framework can help you draw a full picture of an ideal state future, where leadership has incentive to start funding your efforts incrementally and see where the targeted ideal state is. They need to understand how is your MVP propsal can lead to the ideal world (bigger scope).
